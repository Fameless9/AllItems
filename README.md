# All Items Plugin

This is a small plugin for players who really want to spend a lot of time grinding, or just content creators who want to make a series out of this game mode.

Basically, the goal is to collect every item in the game, but with a few exceptions - most unobtainable items are excluded by default, but it is still possible to get an unobtainable item. If this happens, use the `/skip` command.

If you want to see the items you've collected so far, you can use the `/stats` command, which will list each item in a nice 9x6 inventory. Everything is saved, even after a server restart.

I recommend not to mess with the `data.json` or the `config.yml`, as this may cause the plugin to malfunction.
